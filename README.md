Car service - Idle game (test for work)
Idea:
A game about car service.
Build car service stations - Customers arrive - Repair customers with parts - Parts
are made at the factory - Build factories - Parts are stored in the warehouse - Complex parts
are created by crafting from parts from the factory - Level progress opens new factories,
construction zones, larger warehouse, more car service stations
Build gas stations - Customers arrive - Refuel with fuel - Fuel is made
at the factory - Fuel is stored in the warehouse

Car Service - Idle Game (Test for Work)

Idea: A game about car service.

We build car repair shops - Clients arrive - We repair clients with parts - Parts
are made at the factory - We build factories - Parts are stored in the warehouse - Complex parts
are created by crafting from parts from the factory - Level progress opens new factories,
construction zones, larger warehouses, more car repair shops
We build gas stations - Clients arrive - They refuel - Fuel is made
at the factory - Fuel is stored in the warehouse
